Write an application using Angular or React that allows a user to search the current weather by city. The application should also allow a user to view previous searches. Pull current weather data from the Open Weather Map Current API (https://openweathermap.org/current). You will need to sign up to get an API key.  

When finished, open a pull request.

### Step 1
Create a page that allows a user to type in a city and search for the current weather. The current weather will be displayed back to the user and should include:

1. current conditions
2. brief description of weather
3. city name
4. time of the search

### Step 2
Display a list of the user's search history. The history should include the same displayed fields as above. You can display both the current search and history on the same page.
